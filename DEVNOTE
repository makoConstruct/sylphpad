About features:
As for the menu that pops up when user holds alt, it should be clear that this autohiding behavior is present for ultra-minimalism. I used to have it allow alt key combinations through[alt+o, enter would get you straight to the font options, for example], it was perfectly usable. The problem with having a menu take focus whenever alt is pressed is that gtk menus block window manager keyboard shortcuts, so alt+f4 for example, will be blocked. I don't know why the fuck GTK thinks this is good, or even why it's allowed by X.
I misidentified the cause of the blocking as being the code I made to filter the key-events[was necessary for alt+o and kind to work] and stripped it out. It was a hack anyway though so I hope I never think I'll need it back.

The pointer-cursor unification is achieved by sister callbacks on_mouse_move and track_cursor_catch_typing. Each calls the other incident to its function, though in different ways[one recursive, one results in the call happening after it concludes], so I established a locking system between them to prevent inconsistencies.


TODO:
gotta hook mouse=cursor to movement events of the text view. There's a bug that happens when you seek to text off the bottom of the visible section of a scrolling window where the pointer moves off the window that this should ply.

make control click select entire words[ctrl doubleclick does but that's pretty poor ergonomics really, since ctrl click was never assigned to anything]

Might be a good idea to investigate the tax brought by simply moving the mouse in the feild. It's pretty ugly.
I think I might have helped it a little by blocking moves to shift the cursor when the mouse hasn't movedy an entire character.

Put the menu thing back into a bar. The problems you faced and overcame[then reverted for some reason] with this one should not be present in the same form as you thought. Though the problem of making a menubar autohide is not garunteed to be easily solvable.

Start removing references to leafpad. In this I'm torn between wanting to because the original leafpad project might be offended by my changes, and not wanting to because it feels like I'm stripping away all the credit it deserves.

Other known inconsistencies:
	sometimes the mouse pointer's visible when you type, sometimes not. WTF.
	It's not possible to mouse-cursor into an empty line. WTF.
